# Overview

This repo contains code samples focused on creating reusable and maintainable WordPress code while following best practices.

Since I don’t have extensive experience with custom blocks and Full-Site Editing (FSE), I used WordPress’ Create Block Theme plugin to set up a block theme as a starting point. I also used the create-block script to scaffold a few blocks for demonstration purposes.

For the .html template with a dynamic string showing the current date, I created a reusable block that outputs the full date both in the editor and directly in a template. I placed it in the theme’s index.html template to demonstrate how it can be used within a template, making this functionality reusable across the site.

I combined the .scss file and custom block tasks to create a block with an editable image, heading, and description. The .scss uses Grid and Flexbox, handles responsiveness, and adds subtle animations and transitions to enhance the block.

With additional time, I would explore any opportunites for refactoring, further refine the theme, expand it with additional templates and blocks, and clean up some of the extra scaffolding code generated by the create-block script.
